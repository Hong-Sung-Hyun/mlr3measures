# mlr3measures

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/mlr-org/mlr3measures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mlr-org/mlr3measures)

Implements multiple performance measures for supervised learning in [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/).
Includes the most common measures for regression and classification.
Additionally provides meta information about the performance measures, e.g. what the best and worst possible performances scores are.

Uses [checkmate](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=checkmate) to perform checks of the arguments efficiently - no other dependencies.
